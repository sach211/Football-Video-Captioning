# Football-Video-Captioning

Generation of a narrative for a football match using video imagery as the input. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), features present in a frame of the video were identified and then subsequently captioned using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). By captioning in batches of 50 frames, we was effectively able to generate a summary of the match.
